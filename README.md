# Soil-layers_Union
This is a scenario where assuming soil scientists characterize and classify soils into different groups. Each group of soil has
differing ability to hold water depending on the particles inside. For the sake of simplicity, you are given the internal structure of soil as n-by-n grid of cells. Each cell is either 1 or 0. You are asked to implement and use the Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression union-find algorithm to solve whether a soil example allows water to drain. You are not allowed to use union-find implementations provided in alg4.jar
